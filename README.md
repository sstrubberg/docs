# Veritone Docs

This is the source code to the Veritone aiWARE platform documentation available at [docs.veritone.com](https://docs.veritone.com).
If you'd like to read the documentation, it's probably easiest to do it there.
If you find something you think is inaccurate, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/veritone/docs/issues/new).

## Contributing

If you would like to suggest an edit to the docs, feel free to submit a pull request.
You'll probably want to chat with us in our [Slack community][veri-slack] first if it's a large change
to make sure we're in alignment.

### Overview

Veritone Docs is a static site built using Markdown files and powered by [Docsify][docsify].

### Requirements

- node 8
- yarn

### Developing Locally

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will spin up a local instance of the docs at http://localhost:3000.

### Submitting Changes

To submit changes, create a branch off master, add your commits, and create a pull request from your branch to master.
If the branch is in this repo (not a fork) and the name begins with `feature/VTN-` (internal Veritone users only), 
our build system will build it and let you know if it passed in the PR.
Once the PR is merged into master, it will be auto-deployed to docs.veritone.com.

### How to add code examples

Note the code type distinction after the 3 backticks.  It can be any of the following codes:

- graphql
- json
- javascript
- python
- bash
- http
- css
- html

```graphql
query {
  temporalDataObjects {
    records {
      id
      name
      description
      tasks {
        records {
          id
          name
          description
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How to add important content or general tip snippets.

See the [docsify documentation](https://docsify.js.org/#/helpers) for the available helpers.
Our conventions for this repo are as follows:

- `>` is used for generally helpful hints and tips.
- `?>` is used for more important hints and tips.
While `>` could probably be skipped over by the reader and they'd still be successful, we expect they need to read the `?>` notes. 
- `!>` is used for warnings about deprecated or otherwise problematic "land mines" the user should stay away from.

### How to add a new link to the side bar

To add a new link to the sidebar, please add a new entry to the [_sidebar.md file](docs/_sidebar.md)

### How to add a new child link to an existing side bar link

To add a child link to the sidebar, navigate to the child folder and update the `_sidebar.md` file to include the child link.
See https://github.com/veritone/veritone.github.io/blob/develop/docs/engines/quick-start/_sidebar.md for an example.
