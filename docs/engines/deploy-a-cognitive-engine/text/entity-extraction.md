# Entity Extraction

Entity extraction, sometimes referred to as 'named entity extraction' is an aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that refers to labeling words, phrases or even concepts in text. 

The labels are often times things like `place` or `organization`.
They can also denote `time` or `date`, which can be quite useful when pre-processing large chunks of text.

# Use Case

When building a search engine, I may wish to index people, places, and things so that my customers can find content based on those categories.
For example, I might have an article that talks about the City of `London`.
For my users, they would like to find articles about the place when searching for `London`, but I'd have articles about people named `London` ranked lower.

This is possible with named entity extraction.
