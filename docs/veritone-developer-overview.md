# Overview of Veritone Developer 
Veritone is a provider of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and solutions to the media and entertainment, legal and compliance, government, and more industries. 

Our proprietary aiWARE platform, much like a traditional operating system, provides a common, open software infrastructure that lets you build and use end-to-end, AI-powered solutions — from data ingestion to intelligent data analysis — accessible in the application of your choice. 

This approach combined with our proprietary orchestration technology, Conductor, makes it possible to quickly and accurately analyze massive amounts of diverse information — audio, video, image, text, and more — from multiple sources and formats to produce actionable intelligence in a faster, more scalable, and more cost-effective way than humans can.

We believe in the wisdom of the crowd. That’s why we built a machine learning ecosystem comprised of third-party cognitive engines and native, trainable machine learning models to achieve the breadth of capabilities and depth of specialization needed in AI applications to meet virtually any use case you might have. Today, our developer ecosystem supports over 30 different cognitive capabilities and counting within the speech, text, vision, biometrics, audio, data, and transformation cognitive classes.

If you’re looking for a sales channel for your AI software products, to add intelligent features to an existing application, or to leverage robust infrastructure for AI development and custom machine learning model training - Veritone’s aiWARE platform can help.

## Developers Role in aiWARE
Veritone aiWARE provides a production-ready platform for developers to deploy proprietary software including trained machine learning models, applications, data schemas, and data ingestion adapters for your own use privately or to monetize your tech by making it public for Veritone customer usage.

Within aiWARE’s developer environment, Veritone Developer, you can choose the best mix of cognitive engines, APIs, application modules, and third-party integrations to create public or private AI solutions you want to create to meet your use case.

Looking to generate revenue? Partner with us to deploy your technology publicly and gain exposure to our industry-leading customers. When they use your technology, you get paid.

To get started, create a Veritone Developer account. 

## Roadmap 
Like aiWARE itself, Veritone Developer continues to evolve rapidly.
Our goal is to support an ever-increasing spectrum of cognitive Classes and Capabilities over time.
Our future roadmap includes tools, reporting, and new functionality that will make it easier for developer partners to understand the platform, onboard their software, monitor usage, benchmark results, and iterate.
We want and need our partners to be successful so your candid feedback is always welcome as we look to improve.
Look for novel innovations in the months to come - including App Packages, Workflow App, Virtuous Cycle, and Benchmarking.

# Developer Personas
Veritone Developer has been designed to serve many different constituent groups and developer types, in conjunction with other ongoing platform features and capabilities available via aiWARE.
An overview of capabilities and features relevant to different types of developers is below.  

## For Engine Developers
In basic terms, "Cognitive Engine" is the term used by Veritone for software that facilitates the processing of data to produce metadata.
Most often an Engine will consist of a Docker container image containing executable code for a local ML algorithm or one hosted remotely and accessible via API.
Veritone Developer enables users to define a new engine conforming to engine Veritone specifications such as Class, Capability, Engine Processing Mode, Deployment Mode etc and then a series of Builds for that Engine.
After UAT and deployment by Veritone, an Engine becomes available to aiWARE users either as a Public or Private engine.

### Tools
- **Training Data**: Engine developers have access to collections of data entities grouped as libraries. Developers can also upload additional data entities and create their own libraries.

### Opportunities
 - **Monetization**: Receive payment upfront for use of your engines.
 - **Competitive Positioning**: Discover ways to differentiate your offering through feature and capability comparisons.

## For Application Developers

aiWARE provides the building blocks and tools needed to build AI-powered solutions, even without any Machine Learning knowledge.
Veritone Developer enables you to use the best mix of cognitive capabilities, modular UI elements, data ingestion, metadata storage, search functionality, and more.
You can choose to make your application available directly through aiWARE, either publicly or privately.

Moreover, Veritone enables you to reach new customers for your application.
Developer partners are entitled to two revenue streams: 70% of any application licensing revenue collected by Veritone, and 7% of ongoing cognitive processing fees that are utilized by the application.

## For Dataset Providers
Datasets can take several forms within Veritone Developer, and Veritone continues to add new features and functionality to extend capabilities related to making useful datasets available for model training, augmentation of or correlation to metadata, or to add context to the UI presentation of cognitive processing.
Our roadmap includes a marketplace for data to enable users to license their data products within Veritone Developer.

## For IT Professionals
Veritone Developer is useful to Systems Integrators and internal IT departments to build and deploy integrations to existing or new systems and platforms using Veritone's APIs.
They can also integrate proprietary engines, applications and datasets to customize aiWARE to specific use cases. 

## For Data Scientists
Developer App is currently used by in-house Data Scientists and external data science teams to rapidly deploy the results of their modeling, and to enable end users to utilize the resulting cognitive processing for existing use cases and entirely new, bespoke data analysis projects.
Veritone continues to iterate on tools and functionality relevant to data scientists, including Virtuous Cycle and Benchmarking.
